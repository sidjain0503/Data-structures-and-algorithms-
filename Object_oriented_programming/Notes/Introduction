Classes and objects : 

Class : 
Class is a template which has all methods and variables in it . 

Objects : Class is a logical construct that doenst exists , but the object is something that actually exixts . 
Object is an instance of object . 

Properties of objects : 
State ;  value from its data type 
Identity : 
behaviour : Effect of the data type operartions , 
            methods and etc . 


How do we create objects ? 

new keyword : dynamically allocates memory and allocates a reference variable to the object . 
All class objects are allocated dynamically . 

Student stud1 = new Student();  

Student() ---> is a constructor : a special function which runs when a object has been created . 


Some key points : 
By default values --> strings : null 
                      int : 0 
                      float : 0.0
                      boolean  : false 

If inside a class some default value is there       

"this" keyword 



constructor overloading ! 

Student random = new Student(kunal);

Student (Student other){
    this.name = other.name; 
    this.rno = other.rno ; 
     
}

memory allocation of new keyword. 

Wrapper classes : 
    wrapper classes are used to initialise primitive data types as objects . 



Final keyword --> 
    final int INCREASE  = 10 ; 
    // you cant modify this .  always initailise while 
    


Garbage Collection .
