Packages, Static, Singleton Class, In-built Methods



Packages : A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages
How does java knows which package to look for ? 
we can import the package that we wanna use . 


import static com.siddharth.packages.a.Message.message

public class Greeting{
    public static void main(String[] args){

        message(); 
    }
}



What is static in java ?? 

Such Properties which are not related to the objects , but is common to all the objects of the class are called as static properties . 
** So even no object is created you can still use the static methods and variables . 
** thus you can use a main function without creating the object of that class . 
Static methods and objects belongs to the class ,not to the object . 
Inside a static method you cannot access non static data . 
you cannot acess it without creating any object. 
ex Human class : have properties --> 
                                    age , name,salary , population 

Important points for static stuff : 
** You cannot use "this" inside any static block . 


Singleton Class :
When you have a class and you need just one instace of that class . 
you should now allow anyh object to use the constructor then its just called one time .
